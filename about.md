The WMU Library houses more twenty thousand print titles pertinent to the study
of maritime affairs. Additionally, the library subscribes to several major
databases and full-text journals offering online access to tens of thousands
more titles.

The library circulates most of the material in its physical inventory.
Borrowing privileges are reserved for WMU students, faculty and staff, and
members of the WMU Board of Governors. Temporary borrowing privileges to
outside researchers may be extended at the discretion of the librarian.

Access to the library's catalogue is available to all users via the world wide
web. Access to the library's online databases and journals is generally
reserved for members of the WMU community.
